# Ciclo_Hamiltoniano
A C program to verify whether a 5 vertex graph is Hamiltonian or not, and propose a solution. This algorithm uses Backtracking. This was actually a College Assignment from the Data Structures 1 subject. 

If you happen to understand Brazillian Portuguese, this is a video of me explaining the algorithm: https://youtu.be/DP0ybJ-8uQ4

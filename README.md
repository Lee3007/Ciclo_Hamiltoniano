# Hamiltonian Cicle
An algorithm developed in C to verify , through backtracking, whether a 5 vertex graph is Hamiltonian or not, and propose a solution. It interprets a graph as a Connections Matrix that represents the graphs paths/connections. This was actually a College Assignment from the Data Structures 1 subject.

If you happen to understand Brazillian Portuguese, this is a video of me explaining the algorithm: https://youtu.be/DP0ybJ-8uQ4
